                <h2>Welcome to our local Stamp Club</h2>
                <p>The Fraser Valley Philatelic Club has been a cornerstone of the local philatelic community for 50
                    years,
                    fostering an appreciation for stamp collecting and postal history among enthusiasts of all ages.</p>

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>The Fraser Valley Philatelic (stamp) Club had its origins in the early 1960's. The meetings
                    originally
                    occurred once a month either in Chilliwack, Abbotsford or Mission. In the 1980s the club began
                    holding
                    all of its monthly meetings in Abbotsford, since most of the membership lived in that vicinity. At
                    its
                    peak, the club was the largest stamp club west of Edmonton with approximately 100 members, with a
                    monthly turn out of 50-60 members.</p>

                <p>The meetings now have 25-35 people. Even though the membership is receding there is still an
                    enthusiastic group that may be able to assist any aspiring collectors or assist in disposing of
                    collections long neglected or inherited.</p>

                <p>To promote the study of philately, support the preservation of philatelic materials, and provide a

                <h2>EVALUATING A STAMP COLLECTION</h2>
                <p>Stamp collections can be quite different in terms of value. Collections can range from extensive and
                    valuable to a kidâ€™s collection (of little value and collected for fun). To dispose of a collection
                    it may be best to determine the worth of the material, and how it was originally obtained: such as
                    purchases from dealers or post offices, an inheritance from a family member, or as a gift from
                    neighbours and/or friends. Formal appraisals usually are only needed for better collections and can
                    be quite expensive. For a free appraisal you might consider obtaining advice from a local stamp
                    club. They will be able to suggest options for your particular collection including:</p>
                <ul class="indented-list">
                    <li>Private sale</li>
                    <li>Sell through auction sites for better material (usually a 25-30% fee).</li>
                    <li>Donation to a local charity or local stamp club.</li>
                    <li>Gift to a collector in the family, such as a child or grandchild.</li>
                    <li>Sell directly to a dealer</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p>The Fraser Valley Stamp Club can give a free, quick appraisal and may provide some recommendations.
