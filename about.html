            <h2>Welcome to our local Stamp Club</h2>
            <p>The Fraser Valley Philatelic Club has been a cornerstone of the local philatelic community for 50 years,
                fostering an appreciation for stamp collecting and postal history among enthusiasts of all ages.</p>

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>The Fraser Valley Philatelic (stamp) Club had its origins in the early 1960's. The meetings originally
                occurred once a month either in Chilliwack, Abbotsford or Mission. In the 1980s the club began holding
                all of its monthly meetings in Abbotsford, since most of the membership lived in that vicinity. At its
                peak, the club was the largest stamp club west of Edmonton with approximately 100 members, with a
                monthly turn out of 50-60 members.</p>

                <p>The meetings now have 25-35 people. Even though the membership is receding there is still an
                enthusiastic group that may be able to assist any aspiring collectors or assist in disposing of
                collections long neglected or inherited.</p>
